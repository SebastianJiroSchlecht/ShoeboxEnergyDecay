This is the accompanying repository to the paper submission for JASA by Sebastian J. Schlecht, Karolina Prawda, Rudolf Rabenstein, Maximilian Sch√§fer. The paper is currently in review.


## Abstract
The image-source method is widely applied to compute room impulse responses (RIRs) of shoebox rooms with arbitrary absorption. However, with increasing RIR lengths, the number of image sources grows rapidly, leading to slow computation. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the damping density, which characterizes the overall multi-slope energy decay. The omnidirectional energy decay over time is directly derived from the damping density. The resulting energy decay model accurately matches the late reverberation simulated via the image-source method. The proposed model allows the fast stochastic synthesis of late reverberation by shaping noise with the energy envelope. Simulations of various wall damping coefficients demonstrate the model's accuracy. The proposed model consistently outperforms the energy decay prediction accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approximation method. The paper elaborates on the proposed damping density's applicability to modeling multi-sloped sound energy decay, predicting reverberation time in non-diffuse sound fields, and fast frequency-dependent RIR synthesis.
