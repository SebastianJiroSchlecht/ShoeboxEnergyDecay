# Improved Energy Decay Model of the Image Source Method of a Shoebox-Shaped Room

This is the accompanying repository to the paper submission for JASA by Sebastian J. Schlecht, Karolina Prawda, Rudolf Rabenstein, Maximilian Sch√§fer. The paper is currently in review.


## Abstract
The image-source method is widely applied to compute room impulse responses (RIRs) of shoebox-shaped rooms with arbitrary damping. However, with increasing RIR lengths, image sources grow rapidly, leading to slow computation. We propose an improved directional energy decay model that accurately matches the late reverberation. We derive a closed-form expression for the omnidirectional energy decay, which characterizes the overall multi-slope energy decay. The proposed model allows the fast stochastic synthesis of late reverberation. A Monte Carlo simulation of various damping coefficients and room dimensions demonstrates the model's accuracy. The proposed model outperforms the T60 prediction of an earlier method consistently and more accurately predicts rooms with low absorption.
