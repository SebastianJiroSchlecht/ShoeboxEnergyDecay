# Overview

This is the companion repository for "Damping Density of an Absorptive Shoebox Room derived from the Image-Source Method" by Sebastian J. Schlecht, Karolina Prawda, Rudolf Rabenstein, and Maximilian Sch√§fer. The paper is currently under review for the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.

## Content

The repository contains all Matlab code to reproduce the results shown in the paper. In particular, the code includes
- Closed form expression of the damping density
- Fast stochastic synthesis of frequency-dependent RIR
